# MultipleDiseasePredictionSystem
The proposed system employs a preprocessing module to handle data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction, ensuring the input data is well-suited for the subsequent machine learning models. Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most relevant variables, reducing dimensionality and improving the efficiency of the prediction models. The system supports a wide array of input data formats, facilitating interoperability with electronic health records and other healthcare databases.

Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks are implemented to build predictive models for various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The ensemble learning approach combines the strengths of multiple algorithms, enhancing the overall predictive performance and robustness of the system. Model training is performed on a large and diverse dataset, ensuring the generalizability of the predictive models across different populations.
